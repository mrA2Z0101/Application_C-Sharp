All the programs in this repository are C# Applications that I made with the Windows Forms App

## Distance Calculator
Asks the user for the speed that the car is going and for how many hours. It then takes the two numbers and lists out the hour and the speed. For example if the user says they are going 50mph and doing that for 5 hours, 5 lines will be displayed. It will say for the first hour the user will travel 50mph. For the second hour it will say that the user traveled 100mph and so on.

## Distance Traveled
Asks the user for the speed of the vehicle. There are three buttons to press. The first button says "The distance the car will travel in 5 hours" the second button says "The distance the car will travel in 8 hours" the third button says "The distance the car will travel in 12 hours". When you click one of the buttons, the speed will be multiplied to the number that is assigned to the button.

## Magic Dates
The program has three text boxes. It asks for the Month, Day, and the Year. If the Month and the Day are multiplied and equals the year it will say "the date is Magic!" if not then the day will say "the date is not Magic!"
For example: if the user inputs 02/02/04 which is Feburary 2, 2004. It will display that the date is magic. If the user inputs 10/17/00 on the other hand, which is October 17, 2000. It will display that the date is not magic.

## Latin Translator
The program has three buttons. The buttons say "Autem", "Descendit", "Medium". When Autem is clicked on the word "UP!" is displayed. When Descendit is clicked on the word "DOWN!" is displayed. When the word Medium is clicked on the word "CENTER!" is displayed. Each of these words are Latin and the English term for the Latin word.
